# Pali Suttas Spanish Translation
Translation of suttas from the Pali Canon into Spanish (Río de la Plata dialect).

## 📖 About the Project

This site provides translations of Buddhist discourses (suttas) from the Pali Canon into Spanish, emphasizing literal accuracy and consistency over interpretive or literary phrasing.

### Key Features

- **Literal Approach**: Prioritizes the original meaning of Pali words.
- **Terminological Consistency**: The same Pali term is translated consistently throughout all suttas.
- **Direct Source Consultation**: Final translations are based on the [Digital Pali Dictionary](https://dpdict.net/).
- **Text-Focused**: Avoids frameworks from later commentaries, aiming to reflect the original sutta texts.

This process ensures precision and fidelity to the source material, even when it results in phrasing that reflects Pali syntax.

*Note: Translations use Spanish with Rioplatense regionalisms.*

## 🚀 How to Access and Use the Translations

The completed translations are available in two formats:
- **Website:** The easiest way to read them is on the [project website](https://mjaviem.github.io/suttas-spanish/).
- **Text Files:** The translated files in Markdown (`.md`) format are located in the `/docs` folder of this repository. You can download and read them with any text editor.

## 🛠 Translation Process

Translation workflow and management are handled using [OmegaT](https://omegat.org/), a professional computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool. This allows us to maintain a consistent glossary and translation memory across the entire project.
