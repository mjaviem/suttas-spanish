# Pali Suttas Spanish Translation
Translation of suttas from the Pali Canon into Spanish (Río de la Plata dialect).

## 📖 About the Project

This site provides translations of Buddhist discourses (suttas) from the Pali Canon into Spanish, emphasizing literal accuracy and consistency over interpretive or literary phrasing.

### Key Features

- **Literal Approach**: Prioritizes the original meaning of Pali words. Translations are direct from Pali, using dictionaries and English versions as support.
- **Terminological Consistency**: The same Pali term is translated consistently throughout all suttas, even if the result sounds unusual in Spanish.
- **Text-Focused**: This translation stays close to the sutta itself, without adding interpretations or commentary.
-- **Direct Source Consultation**: Final translations are based on the [Digital Pali Dictionary](https://dpdict.net/).

This process ensures precision and fidelity to the source material, even when it results in phrasing that reflects Pali syntax.

*Note: Translations use Spanish with Rioplatense regionalisms.*

## 🚀 How to Access and Use the Translations

The completed translations are available in two formats:
- **Website:** The easiest way to read them is on the [project website](https://mjaviem.github.io/suttas-spanish/).
- **Text Files:** The translated files in Markdown (`.md`) format are located in the `/docs` folder of this repository. You can download and read them with any text editor.

## 🛠 Translation Process

Translation workflow and management are handled using [OmegaT](https://omegat.org/), a professional computer-assisted translation (CAT) tool. This allows us to maintain a consistent glossary and translation memory across the entire project.

### Abbreviations and Editing of Original Texts

In the Pali Canon, abbreviations such as `...pe...` are commonly used to omit passages repeated in other suttas. For clarity, these passages are sometimes completed using parallel texts and shown in brackets.
## Key Pali Terms

Some words are left untranslated in Pali. If you are not familiar with them, here are their meanings:

- **Arahant**: Worthy. Deserving.
- **Bhante**, **bhadante**: Reverend.
- **Bhikkhu**: Monk.
- **Saṅgha**: Congregation.
- **Tathāgata**: Epithet of the Buddha.
